### Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles mostly for *[zsh](https://zsh.org)* and *[emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)*

#### Shell Prompt (no [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh))
**Features for *zsh***
- parent directories are truncated to four characters
- arrow becomes red if previous command raised an error
- indicator on the current line
- current prompt is bolded previous aren't
