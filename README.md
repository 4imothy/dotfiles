### Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles mostly for *[zsh](https://zsh.org)*, *[vim](https://www.vim.org/)* and *[emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)*

**Features for *zsh***
- Easy customizing of how many characters to show of parent directories
- Final prompt characters become red if previous command raised an error
- Indicator on the current line
- Colored git branch, green if no changes, yellow if committed, and green if up to date with origin
- VI on command line along with easy configuration for
changing cursor shape and color based on current VI mode,
this configuration will also be used in *vim*
